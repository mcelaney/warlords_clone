defmodule Warlords.Core.Units do
  @moduledoc """
  Units are the armies which players control on the gameboard.

  # Heros

  Heros offer themselves for hire at semi-random intervals. They have no upkeep
  cost. Only heros can search ruins and pick up items. They apply a strength
  modifier to all other armies in their stack.

  # Special Units

  Units can join heros when hired or they can be found in ruins.

  # Standard Units

  Standard armies may be produced in cities. Once produced it's expected they
  will be added to a stack, groups of armies which are the actual units players
  control on the gameboard.
