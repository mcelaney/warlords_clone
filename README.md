# Warlords

An open source clone of an old PC game I love. To try it out - download the
official iOS port [from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/warlords-classic-strategy/id532024361).

## Why is this a thing

This app will exist to demonstrate a bunch of Elixir and Phoenix ideas I'm
likely to try to describe to someone else. My goal is for this to eventually be
actually playable someday - but for the moment it's more a set of katas I
intend to work on as part of my daily routine.
